I am a PhD student in Neuroscience at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver. My research lies at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning, with a focus on modeling brain activity using modern AI methods. I’m particularly interested in neural coding, functional connectivity, and developing biologically inspired models to understand vision and population dynamics in the brain.
