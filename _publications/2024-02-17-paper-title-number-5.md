## Abstract
Mobile GPU drivers are critical components in modern mobile systems, yet they remain vulnerable to attacks due to their large attack surface and privileged access. This paper presents a novel approach to securing mobile GPU drivers using hypervisor-based virtualization. Our solution isolates the GPU driver in a separate virtual machine while maintaining performance and compatibility with existing applications.

## Key Contributions
* Novel virtualization architecture for mobile GPU drivers
* Comprehensive security analysis and evaluation
* Performance optimizations for minimal overhead
* Implementation and evaluation on real mobile devices
